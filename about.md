My name is <b>Prince Kumar Lat</b>. I have a background in <b>engineering</b> with deep interest in biology. I am a passionate researcher and an amateaur <b>Data Scientist</b> trying to answer some of the most puzzling questions in <i>biology</i> using tools of <b>biophysics</b>, <b>bioinformatics</b>, machine learning, <b>biochemistry</b> and <b>molecular biology</b>. I aim to make use of my programming, teamwork, and mathematical skills for social good. I have an eagerness to promote science within the community and a quest to improve the quality of human health though a combination of scientific innovation and technological development.

I was born in Jamui - a small town in the Bihar province of India. My early education was from DAV Public School Jamui. I completed my B.Tech in 2015 from <b>IIT Kanpur</b>, India, with a major in <b><i>Bioengineering</i></b>. During my undergrad studies, I got an initial exposure to research while doing a short 3-month internship in the lab of <b>Dr. Detlef Weigel</b> at <b>Max-Planck Institute for Biology</b>, Tubingen, <b>Germany</b>. In Dr. Weigel's lab, I learnt <b>NGS</b> and genomics techniques to sequence the circular RNA in <i>Arabidopsis Thaliana</i>. Further, I did my B.Tech project in the lab of <b>Dr. Nitin Gupta</b> (Bioinformatics Group, BSBE), IIT Kanpur. I used computational tools and python programming to understand the olfactory sensing mechanism in <i>Drosophila</i> (fruit fly).

Fascinated by the irresistible attraction for research to explore something new and innovative, I opted to go for higher studies. In Fall 2015, I moved to <b><i>Canada</i></b> to pursue my doctoral studies from <b>Simon Fraser University</b> (SFU) under the supervision of <b>Dr. Dipankar Sen</b> - disciple of <i>"Nobel Laureate"</i> <b>Dr. Walter Gilbert</b> and godfather of <b>G-Quadruplexes</b>. My Doctoral research was focussed on exploring the untapped potentials of nucleic acids, including G-Quadruplexes and Triplexes. During my PhD, I used a combination of experimental biophysics and computational approach to accomplish 5 independent projects spanning the area of <b>Cancer genomics</b>, <b>Immunology</b>, <b>Neurodegenerative Disorders</b>, <b>DNA Nanotechnology</b>, <b><i>In-silico</i> Simulations</b> and <b>Computational Biology</b> which yielded <b>6</b> high-impact journal publications, <b>11</b> oral/poster presentations and <b>>10</b> awards/Fellowships.

  When I am away from my lab, I enjoy playing <b><i>Flute</i></b> and <b><i>Tabla</i></b> (Indian Drum). Occasionally, I spend few evenings writing poetries in my mother tongue (Hindi).
